/**
 * The only file that talks to AI Glot.
 *
 * It does one thing: take a flat `{ key: "English text" }` object, send it to
 * be translated into every target language in ONE batch, and hand back
 * `{ locale: { key: "translated text" } }`. Everything above it (which strings
 * are missing, where they are written back) lives in `scripts/i18n.mjs`, and
 * everything below it is either the `aiglot` CLI or four HTTP calls.
 *
 * WHY JSON AND NOT CSV. AI Glot reads JSON keys as structure, so a key is
 * never sent as translatable content and cannot come back translated. In a CSV
 * every cell is content, which is why the CSV version of this needed a
 * column-selection step and could still mangle an identifier.
 *
 * WHY ONE BATCH FOR EVERY LANGUAGE. The payload nests by language code, so
 * three locales are one analysis, one plan, one approval and one poll instead
 * of three of each. It is faster, cheaper in round trips, and the translator
 * sees the whole site's copy at once, which is what keeps one term consistent
 * between the home page and the post that links to it.
