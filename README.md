# astro-ai-i18n

An Astro site in four languages. You write English. A command translates the
rest through [AI Glot](https://ai-glot.com), writes the result back as files,
and tells you which translations have fallen behind.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # http://localhost:4321
npm run i18n:status      # what is missing, what is out of date, what it costs
```

A fresh clone builds and serves in four languages. It needs no account, no key
and no network. Every translation it ships is a committed file. You only need
an AI Glot account to produce new ones.

The demo site documents this workflow. It is published in the four languages
the workflow produced.

## What you get

- A status command. It separates *never translated* from *translated, then the
  English changed*.
- A translate command. It sends only what is behind, for every language, in one
  batch.
- Two behaviours for an untranslated page, chosen with one word in a config
  file.
- A language picker in the navbar. No JavaScript. It keeps the reader on the
  same page.
- `AGENTS.md` and a skill, so an AI agent can run the whole workflow.

The site itself is small on purpose: a home page, an about page, a Markdown
journal, four SVGs, no colour. The parts worth copying are `scripts/`,
`src/i18n/` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Translation debt is a number

A lock file stores the hash of the English text each translation was made from.
The tooling compares the current English against that hash. So "out of date" is
a fact, not a guess.

```text
UI copy: src/i18n/strings/en.json, 64 strings

  fr   64 current     0 missing     0 out of date
  de   64 current     0 missing     0 out of date
  es   45 current    19 missing     0 out of date

Journal: src/content/blog/en/, 4 posts

  fr    4 current     0 missing     0 out of date
  de    4 current     0 missing     0 out of date
  es    3 current     1 missing     0 out of date   +typography-notes

~585 source words behind (~195 credits in Lite, ~585 in Standard).

  + missing    ~ English changed since the translation was made
```

That is a real clone. Edit one English sentence and run the command again. That
string moves to `out of date` in all three languages.

## One command translates what is behind

```bash
npm run i18n:translate -- --dry-run   # price it, spend nothing
npm run i18n:translate                # send it, write the files back
git diff                              # review it
```

```text
  src/i18n/strings/en.json          written by hand. The only files that
  src/content/blog/en/*.md          define which strings exist
          │
          │  npm run i18n:status
          │     compares each English string against the hash in the lock file
          ▼
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  fr  current        de  ~ out of date        es  + missing          │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │
          │  npm run i18n:translate
          │     sends what is behind, every locale in ONE AI Glot batch
          ▼
  ┌──────────────┐   create ──▶ plan ──▶ approve ──▶ poll ──▶ download
  │   AI Glot    │              (free)   (the only call that spends credits)
  └──────────────┘
          │
          │  writes the results back as ordinary files
          ▼
  src/i18n/strings/{fr,de,es}.json      generated. Never edited by hand
  src/content/blog/{fr,de,es}/*.md
  .i18n-lock.json                       stores the English hash for each
          │                             translation
          ▼
       git diff                         a person reviews the diff
```

One batch carries every language. That means one analysis, one plan, one
approval. It also means the translator sees the whole site at once, which keeps
a term consistent between a menu label and the page it opens.

Machine translation is acceptable here because a person reads the diff before
it ships.

## An untranslated page is a decision

One word in `src/i18n/config.ts`:

```ts
export const untranslated: 'fallback' | 'redirect' = 'fallback';
```

```text
  a reader opens /de/blog/typography-notes, which German has not translated

  untranslated: 'fallback'               untranslated: 'redirect'
  ───────────────────────────            ───────────────────────────
  200, the English body                  sent to /blog/typography-notes
  a notice saying it is not translated    nothing is served under /de/
  canonical points at /blog/…            the shared link stops working
  not listed as the German alternate     the locale stays honestly small
    in hreflang

  right once a locale is substantial     right while a locale is thin
```

In both modes the page canonicalises to the English URL. Neither mode lists it
as the German alternate. That is what stops four URLs competing for one page's
ranking.

## How the languages work

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| URL shape | `/about` is English. `/fr/about` is French. The default locale has no prefix, so adding a language later moves no existing URL |
| Translation key | the path after the locale. `fr/blog/quiet-tools` is the French `blog/quiet-tools` because the paths match. There is no mapping table |
| Missing string | falls back to English, key by key. `i18n:status` still counts it |
| Missing page | `fallback` or `redirect`, per the section above |
| Adding a language | one entry in `src/i18n/config.ts`, then `npm run i18n:translate` |

Every French, German and Spanish string in this repository was produced by AI
Glot. None were written by hand.

One gap is deliberate. Spanish has no About page and is missing one journal
post. This keeps `i18n:status`, the fallback notice and the picker's `EN` mark
visible on a fresh clone. `npm run i18n:translate` fills them in for about 141
credits.

## Set up AI Glot

1. Create a key at [app.ai-glot.com/developer](https://app.ai-glot.com/developer).
2. Run `cp .env.example .env` and set `AIGLOT_API_KEY`.
3. Run `npm i -g @ai-glot/cli && aiglot auth login`. Or set
   `AIGLOT_TRANSPORT=api` and use no CLI.
4. Run `npm run i18n:translate -- --dry-run`.

Creating a translation and planning it are free. You can repeat them as often
as you like. Only approval spends credits, and `--dry-run` stops before it.

[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) has the full walkthrough, the REST endpoint table and
the cost model.

## Deploying

The build is static. Any host that serves files works: Cloudflare, Netlify,
Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3, your own nginx. Nothing calls an API at runtime. The
translations are committed files.

I use Cloudflare. The shortest path is Workers with static assets:

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy      # after adding a wrangler.jsonc pointing at ./dist
```

Cloudflare Pages, Netlify and Vercel work the same way. Build command
`npm run build`, output directory `dist`.

One decision depends on your host, and only if you chose
`untranslated: 'redirect'`. A static build has no server to answer with a 301,
so that mode renders a meta-refresh page (`src/layouts/Redirect.astro`). It
works everywhere. It is not what you want in production.

| Host | Better answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cloudflare | a Redirect Rule, or `_redirects` on Pages |
| Netlify | `public/_redirects` |
| Vercel | `redirects` in `vercel.json` |
| nginx | `return 301` in the location block |

Move it to a rule and delete that layout. A rule answers before any HTML is
sent. It is faster, and the reader sees no blank page.

The default mode needs none of this. Every locale serves a real page at a real
URL.

## Make it yours

1. Replace `src/i18n/strings/en.json` with your copy and `src/content/blog/en/`
   with your posts. Delete the other locale folders and both
   `.i18n-lock.json` files.
2. Set your languages in `src/i18n/config.ts` and your origin in
   `astro.config.ts`.
3. Update the URLs in `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and
   `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, or delete those files. They point at
   this project's maintainer.
4. Run `npm run i18n:translate`.

Nothing in `src/` or `scripts/` needs editing to change language, copy or
behaviour. If you find something that does, open an issue.
